# ModeDeck

**ModeDeck** is a lightweight, open-source Windows tool built with AutoHotkey v2. It lets you create and launch "modes" â€” sets of apps, files, and URLs that open together.

Stop opening the same tabs, documents, and apps manually. Switch between **Work**, **Study**, or **Watch** modes instantly with one click.

_(Please Note that when opening a Mode for the first time you will need to login and sign-up again in the case of website BUT DON'T WORRY you will only need to do this the first time!)_
